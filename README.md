## :banana: Features

 On the **Fruit page** there is a table that displays all the fruits available in the database. On the indicated page, there are four headings that and the corresponding data definitions assigned to them. The website allows you to search for a fruit in four ways using the form: one input element and three selects elements.
 On the **Fruit App** website, there is a simple application to create a recipe for a fruit salad, select an already existing recipe and an area where the data is displayed. In the place where you can find the list of existing recipes, you can click on the recipe and view the data, or use the delete button to delete the recipe. In the place where the form is located, we have a rigid form to fill in, with the possibility of saving the recipe in the database or turning off the form. There are two ways to display where the data appears. The first way displays data from an existing recipe saved in the database. The second way displays the updating data entered into the form with support for calculating all required data.
